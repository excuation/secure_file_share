A secure file-sharing backend system built using Django and SQLite, with support for:

- Two user roles: **Ops** (admin uploaders) and **Clients** (verified downloaders)
- JWT-based authentication and email verification
- Secure file uploads and token-based downloads
- Complete API coverage with Postman Collection

## 📦 Postman Collection

You can import the complete Postman Collection from this link:

🔗 [Secure File Sharing API Collection (JSON)](https://github.com/excuation/secure_file_share/blob/master/postman/Secure%20File%20Sharing%20API%20Collection.postman_collection.json)

---

### ✅ What This Collection Supports

- 🔐 **Token Extraction & Reuse**  
  Automatically captures and uses JWT tokens, email verification tokens, and download tokens across requests.

- ⚙️ **Pre-request Scripts**  
  Built-in scripts that set headers, environment variables, and prepare tokens before each request.

- 🔗 **Chained Requests**  
  Designed for full flow testing: Signup → Verify → Login → Upload → Download.

---

📁 The collection is located at:  
`/postman/Secure File Sharing API Collection.postman_collection.json`

| `/api/file/list/`                         | GET        | Client   | ✅ (JWT)          | List uploaded files             |

## 💡 Notes

- 🔐 **JWT tokens** are passed in headers like this:  
  `Authorization: Bearer <your_token_here>`

- 📧 **Email verification links** are simulated for testing purposes — tokens are printed in the console or logs. Use them manually in the browser or API call.

- 📥 **Download tokens** are **one-time use** and **expire immediately** after the file is downloaded. If expired or reused, the file will not be accessible.

- ✅ The system handles proper status codes and error responses for invalid or missing tokens.
